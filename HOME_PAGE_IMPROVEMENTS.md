- **Hover Transitions:** 500-700ms for smooth interactions
- **Staggered Delays:** For sequential animations

### Modern UI Elements

3. **Animated Badges:** Ping effects and sparkles
4. **Floating Cards:** Subtle elevation changes
5. **Geometric Patterns:** Dots and circles for depth

## 📱 Responsive Considerations

All sections maintain:
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid systems that collapse gracefully
- Hidden elements on mobile (lg:block)
- Adjusted padding and spacing
- Touch-friendly button sizes (h-16)
