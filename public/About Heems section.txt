About Heems
A Note from the Founder

Heems was created with one clear belief: arranging care for someone you love should feel human, transparent, and dignified — not urgent, confusing, or overwhelming.

Over years working within the wider health and care landscape, one recurring pattern became impossible to ignore.

Care needs rarely arrive at convenient moments.

They follow accidents.
Unexpected diagnoses.
Complex disabilities.
Mental health crises.
Recovery after surgery.
Chronic illness.
Or the gradual realisation that extra support is needed at home.

Again and again, families found themselves facing the same question:

How do we find the right support — clearly, confidently, and without unnecessary confusion?

Hospital discharge dates approached. Rehabilitation plans changed. Community referrals were delayed. Phone calls were made between work commitments. Options were unclear. Availability shifted. Every provider offered reassurance — yet the process often felt fragmented and difficult to navigate.

The stress did not come from a lack of dedicated professionals.

It came from a lack of clarity.

One moment remains particularly vivid.

A young adult recovering from a life-altering injury said quietly:

“I just want to feel normal again — even if it’s just at home.”

That sentiment transcends age.

Whether it is a person requiring extra support, a parent rebuilding strength after illness, a partner managing a long-term condition, or an older relative wishing to remain independent — the underlying need is the same:

To feel safe.
To feel seen.
To feel at home.

Families are not simply arranging services.

They are protecting someone they love — while navigating systems that can feel opaque, rushed, and impersonal.

Traditional models of home support are essential and valuable. Yet administrative layers and limited visibility can sometimes create distance at the very moment reassurance matters most.

Heems was built to provide clarity within a fragmented landscape.

By providing clear information and visibility of independent care professionals, Heems enables families to make informed decisions with confidence.

Care is personal — at every stage of life.

Decisions about care should be supported by clarity, dignity, and confidence.

Heems exists to make that possible.

Why We Exist


Home is where life has been built.
It carries history, routine, and identity. It is where independence feels strongest and dignity feels protected.

When someone begins to need support, remaining at home should feel reassuring. Yet for many families, the process of arranging care becomes complicated — not because care does not exist, but because access to it feels fragmented, rushed, and unclear.

Families are often left navigating a system that was never designed for clarity. Decisions must be made quickly. Information is inconsistent. Costs vary without explanation. Availability shifts daily. Phone calls replace certainty. Stress replaces confidence.

At one of the most vulnerable moments in a family’s life, what is needed most is structure and trust.

Heems exists to change that experience.



Care should not feel chaotic.

Arranging support at home should not feel like negotiating in the dark. It should not require chasing multiple providers for quotes. It should not involve unclear pricing, last-minute uncertainty, or unanswered questions about who is arriving at the door. It should never reduce deeply personal support into a transactional scramble.

Yet too often, the traditional system prioritises process over people.

Heems was created to bring balance back.

By introducing transparency, structured booking systems, and direct visibility of independent professional carers, Heems restores clarity to a moment that too often feels overwhelming. Clear rates. Clear availability. Clear terms. Clear responsibilities.

Because trust is not built through branding alone — it is built through structure.



Independence matters — for everyone.

It matters for those receiving care, who want to remain in control of their choices and daily lives. And it matters equally for those providing it.

Professional carers are the foundation of safe, compassionate support at home. Yet many operate within systems that limit autonomy, compress earnings, and remove flexibility. A sustainable care ecosystem must work for both sides.

Heems supports a more balanced model — one where families can make informed decisions, carers can work independently and sustainably, agreements are clearly defined, expectations are transparent, and payments are structured and secure.

When both sides have clarity, relationships strengthen. When relationships strengthen, care improves.




Empowering Carers

Heems is not only designed for families seeking clarity — it is equally built to support the professionals who deliver care every day.

Independent carers are highly skilled, experienced individuals who often prefer to work outside of traditional agency structures. Many value autonomy, flexibility, and the opportunity to build direct, meaningful relationships with the people they support. Yet too often, existing systems limit that independence — controlling schedules, compressing earnings, and restricting choice.

Heems provides an alternative.

The platform is structured to support carers as independent professionals, offering a transparent environment where they can present their experience, set their own rates, manage availability, and accept bookings that align with their working preferences.

This model recognises carers as autonomous professionals — not allocated resources within a centralised system.
Because empowering carers ultimately strengthens the quality, stability, and sustainability of care itself.

That is the heart of Heems.





Regulatory Status
What is Heems’ regulatory status?

The Care Quality Commission 
(CQC) regulates organisations in England that directly provide regulated health and social care activities — such as personal care delivered under an organised service, nursing care, or medical treatment.

Heems is structured differently.

Heems operates as an introductory platform, providing a digital environment through which families can identify, engage, and arrange support with independent, self-employed carers.


What This Means


As an introductory platform:

1. The provision of care does not take place under the direction or control of the platform.
2. Responsibility for day-to-day service delivery rests with the independent carer and the family engaging their services.
3. Clinical, nursing, or regulated healthcare activities are outside the scope of the platform’s operations.
4. The platform does not act as a healthcare provider and does not substitute medical or regulated professional oversight.

Any agreement for care is formed directly between the family and the independent carer they choose. Responsibility for the delivery, standard, and scope of support rests with those parties. 

Under this structure, Heems operates as an introductory agency rather than a provider of regulated care services and, as such, does not require registration with the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

Scope of Services and Professional Responsibility
Because Heems operates as an introductory platform, independent carers are responsible for ensuring they work within the scope of their training, qualifications, and professional experience.

Where specialist, clinical, or medical support is required, families should coordinate directly with appropriately qualified healthcare professionals.

Heems does not assess clinical competencies, direct care provision, or oversee ongoing service delivery. Its role is limited to facilitating introductions and supporting structured coordination between independent parties.

Heems is a marketplace platform.

We facilitate connection and provide secure infrastructure. The agreement for services exists directly between the family and the independent carer.

This model provides flexibility and choice, while preserving professional responsibility where it belongs.
