            <h2>2.1 Our Safeguarding Approach</h2>
            <p>
                Heems is committed to promoting safety, dignity, and respectful treatment for adults and children who may be vulnerable when using the platform. Although Heems does not deliver regulated care services and is not a care provider, we recognise the importance of acting responsibly and proportionately where safeguarding concerns are identified in connection with platform use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach focuses on early identification of potential risks, appropriate escalation of concerns, and cooperation with relevant authorities where required by law.
            </p>

            <h2>2.2 Scope</h2>
            <p>This Safeguarding Policy applies to all individuals and entities interacting with the Heems platform, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heems employees and authorised representatives;</li>
                <li>Clients, families, and other users of the platform;</li>
                <li>Independent, self-employed carers who offer services through the platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2.3 Safeguarding Principles</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Empowerment</strong> – supporting individuals to make informed choices and respecting their wishes wherever possible;</li>
                <li><strong>Prevention</strong> – taking reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood of harm occurring;</li>
                <li><strong>Proportionality</strong> – responding to concerns in a manner that is appropriate to the level of risk identified;</li>
                <li><strong>Protection</strong> – supporting individuals who may be at risk of harm, abuse, or neglect;</li>
                <li><strong>Partnership</strong> – working cooperatively with relevant authorities, professionals, or organisations where legally required;</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability</strong> – ensuring concerns are recorded, reviewed, and handled responsibly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2.4 Recognising Risk</h2>
            <p>Safeguarding concerns may arise in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:</p>

                <li>Observed behaviours or interactions that raise concern;</li>

                <li>Information received from third parties or relevant authorities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2.5 Types of Abuse and Harm</h2>

            <ul>

            <h2>2.7 Mental Capacity</h2>
            <p>
                Where questions arise regarding an individual's capacity to make decisions, any actions taken by carers or families should be guided by the principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.

                <li>Presuming capacity unless it is clearly established otherwise</li>
                <li>Supporting the individual to make their own decisions wherever possible</li>
                <li>Ensuring that any decision made on behalf of an individual who lacks capacity is made in their best interests</li>
                <li>Choosing the least restrictive option available when acting or making decisions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2.8 Confidentiality and Information Sharing</h2>
            <p>Any information relating to safeguarding concerns will be handled with appropriate care and confidentiality. Information will be:</p>
