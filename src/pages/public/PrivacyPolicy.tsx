            <h2>2. Safeguarding Policy</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Our Safeguarding Approach</h3>
            <p>
                Heems is committed to promoting safety, dignity, and respectful treatment for adults and children who may be vulnerable when using the platform. Although Heems does not deliver regulated care services and is not a care provider, we recognise the importance of acting responsibly and proportionately where safeguarding concerns are identified in connection with platform use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach focuses on early identification of potential risks, appropriate escalation of concerns, and cooperation with relevant authorities where required by law. We aim to create a platform environment that supports safe interactions between clients, families, and independent carers, while respecting individual rights and autonomy.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Scope</h3>
            <p>This Safeguarding Policy applies to all individuals and entities interacting with the Heems platform, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heems employees and authorised representatives;</li>
                <li>Clients, families, and other users of the platform;</li>
                <li>Independent, self-employed carers who offer services through the platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All parties are expected to act in a manner that supports safety, respect, and lawful conduct when using the platform.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Safeguarding Principles</h3>
            <p>Heems’ safeguarding approach is informed by widely recognised safeguarding principles and good practice, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Empowerment</strong> – supporting individuals to make informed choices and respecting their wishes wherever possible;</li>
                <li><strong>Prevention</strong> – taking reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood of harm occurring;</li>
                <li><strong>Proportionality</strong> – responding to concerns in a manner that is appropriate to the level of risk identified;</li>
                <li><strong>Protection</strong> – supporting individuals who may be at risk of harm, abuse, or neglect;</li>
                <li><strong>Partnership</strong> – working cooperatively with relevant authorities, professionals, or organisations where legally required;</li>
                <li><strong>Accountability</strong> – ensuring concerns are recorded, reviewed, and handled responsibly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These principles guide how safeguarding matters are identified, assessed, and escalated through the platform.</p>

            <h3>2.4 Recognising Risk</h3>
            <p>Safeguarding concerns may arise in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Direct disclosures from clients, carers, or family members;</li>
                <li>Observed behaviours or interactions that raise concern;</li>
                <li>Complaints or reports submitted through the platform;</li>
                <li>Information received from third parties or relevant authorities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All safeguarding concerns are taken seriously. Reports are reviewed promptly and handled in line with this policy and applicable legal requirements.</p>

            <h3>2.5 Types of Abuse and Harm</h3>
            <p>Safeguarding concerns may relate to a range of potential risks or harms, including (but not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical harm or inappropriate physical treatment;</li>
                <li>Emotional or psychological harm;</li>
                <li>Financial abuse, exploitation, or coercion;</li>
                <li>Sexual abuse or inappropriate conduct;</li>
                <li>Neglect or acts of omission, including self-neglect;</li>
                <li>Discriminatory abuse;</li>
                <li>Exploitation, undue influence, or controlling behaviour.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.6 Reporting Concerns</h3>
            <p>Anyone who becomes aware of a safeguarding concern should take appropriate action without delay. This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contacting emergency services where there’s an immediate risk of harm</li>
                <li>Reporting a concern to the relevant local authority or safeguarding body</li>
                <li>Notifying Heems where the concern relates to the use of the platform</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Heems will escalate concerns to appropriate authorities when legally required.</p>

            <h3>2.7 Mental Capacity</h3>
            <p>Where questions arise regarding an individual’s capacity to make decisions, any actions taken by carers or families should be guided by the principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Presuming capacity unless it is clearly established otherwise</li>
                <li>Supporting the individual to make their own decisions wherever possible</li>
                <li>Ensuring that any decision made on behalf of an individual who lacks capacity is made in their best interests</li>
                <li>Choosing the least restrictive option available when acting or making decisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Heems does not assess mental capacity and does not make decisions on behalf of clients. Responsibility for complying with the Mental Capacity Act rests with the individuals involved in the care arrangement and any relevant legal representatives or authorities.</p>

            <h3>2.8 Confidentiality and Information Sharing</h3>
            <p>Any information relating to safeguarding concerns will be handled with appropriate care and confidentiality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shared only where necessary and on a need-to-know basis</li>
                <li>Processed in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy legislation, including the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018</li>
                <li>Disclosed to relevant authorities or safeguarding bodies only where required by law or where there is a serious risk to an individual’s safety</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Heems does not investigate safeguarding matters but may share relevant platform-related information with appropriate authorities when legally obligated to do so.</p>

            <h2>3. Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion Policy</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Our Commitment</h3>
            <p>
                Heems is committed to promoting equality, diversity, and inclusion across its platform. We aim to create a respectful and inclusive environment for all users, including clients, families, carers, and partners.

            <h3>3.3 Fair and Objective Practice</h3>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Heems does not make decisions based on personal characteristics unrelated to platform safety, lawful use, or service suitability.</p>

            <h3>3.4 Complaints and Concerns</h3>
            <p>
                Any concerns or complaints relating to discrimination, unfair treatment, or exclusion may be raised with Heems through the appropriate reporting channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heems will review such concerns promptly, impartially, and in accordance with applicable legislation and internal procedures. Where appropriate, actions may be taken to address breaches of this policy, including restriction or removal of access to the platform.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Review &amp; Governance</h2>
            <p>
                Heems is committed to maintaining clear, effective, and legally compliant policies that support the safe and responsible operation of the platform.
            </p>
            <p>These policies are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compliant with applicable laws, regulations, and data protection requirements;</li>
                <li>Relevant to the ongoing operation and development of the Heems platform;</li>
                <li>Aligned with recognised best practice for online platforms operating within the care and support sector.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Policy reviews may be conducted periodically, or in response to changes in legislation, regulatory guidance, platform functionality, or identified operational risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where updates or amendments are made, revised versions will be published on the Heems website with updated effective and review dates. Continued use of the platform following publication of updated policies constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
